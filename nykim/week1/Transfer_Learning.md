 - A Machine Learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

### Pre-training
- pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision, and NLP

- first, train a base network on a base dataset and task.
### Fine-tuning
- pre-training된 모델을 가지고 new dataset의 목적에 맞게 학습시키며 parameters 조정
